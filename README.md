To solve the issue of QuanX ping issue


proxy/vmess/encoding: invalid user: VMessAEAD is enforced and a non VMessAEAD connection is received. You can still disable this security feature with environment variable v2ray.vmess.aead.forced = false . You will not be able to enable legacy header workaround in the future.

After QuanX release aead fix for vmess, will use the official v2ray.
